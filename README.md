Before running scripts, mapped read files should be downloaded. HTSeq counts for mouse, alligator, and Anolis can be downloaded from GEO repository GSE108337. HTSeq counts for chicken can be downloaded as a supplementary data file, linked in the manuscript. Sequencing data for human limb samples is available through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) under study accession number phs001226.v1.p1.
